            <div class="border">My name is CharMel and I am proud Transgender Woman Photographer. Yes, you read it right. I rise above the occasions on changing the norm that WE TOO CAN DO IT. I love to travel because I want to experience the culture at hand. My work is what makes me feel euphoric, meaningful and happy. What I love about my passion is the people that I encounter and to create a positive impact.
                join me in my journey to explore and promote diversity through art.</div>
